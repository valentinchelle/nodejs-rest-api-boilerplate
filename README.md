# NodeJs Api Boilerplate

A boilerplate for **NodeJs** Rest Api.

You probably know how hard it is to start a node js API, with a well structured and clean code. Especially if you are on a rush for an hackhaton or a school project.
I give you here a clean code, that implements what essential for a new API project : a clean nodejs structure implementing a User System following the best practices.

You can directly plug this API with the front end of your choice by calling the different endpoints. I also give details on how to extend this code to adapt it for your project.

# Prerequisites

- Please make sure that you have:
- node.js installed (https://nodejs.org/)
- have mongodb installed and running locally (https://www.mongodb.com/)
  - Using Windows, just open the terminal at where you installed mongo and run `mongod.exe`
- run npm install in your root project folder

# Features

(STILL IN DEVELOMENT)

- [x] Clean Structure Component Oriented
- [ ] Templates to create your own components
- [x] Secure Authentification System with email/password using **JWT**.
- [ ] Change Password
- [ ] Forgot Password
- [ ] Reset Password
- [ ] Delete Account
- [ ] OAuth 2.0 Authentication via Facebook, Google
- [ ] Easy-to-use endpoints

# Usage

To run the project, please use a command line the following:

- npm start

  - It will run the server at port 3600.

- mongodb configuration in common/services/mongoose.service

- Add a file `.env` at the root of the folder (same level as `index.js`), copy paste the following template and fill it with the right information like :

```
PORT=3600
APP_END_POINT=http://localhost:3600
API_END_POINT=http://localhost:3600
JWT_SECRET=r4ndomStr1ng
JWT_EXPIRATION_IN_SECONDS=36000
```

# Structure

The structure of this boilerplate follows the guideines of the component oriented structure :
Each component corresponds to a folder, and follows an Model Controller Middlewares sub structure :

- **models** for the database entities ( like `users` ). It is where the schema, and the communication with the table are defined (like `UserModelfindById`).
- **controllers/** for the actions on the models, that call the models actions ( like the management of the list of the users).
- **middlewares/** intermediaries between the request and the response. Usually uses and modifies the request body parameters.
- **routes.js** for the definition of the endpoints for each actions of the controllers. Defines also what are the middleware used for the routes.

The global logic for an app calling this rest API :
The app will call an API route ( like `url/modifyuser` ). The router makes the request pass through the middleware (`isConnected()`) towards the controller action (`modifyUser()`). The controller action will then call the model to modify a record in the table.

## Api Endpoints

### `localhost:3600/users` : Insert a new user

Request Body :

```
{
	"firstname": "Valentin",
	"lastname": "Rigolo",
	"email": "valentin.rigolo@azerty.com",
	"password": "secret"

}
```

# Understanding the login logic

## Step 1 : Login with credentials

The first step in the login process, is for a registered user to send its email/passsword.
Endpoint : `endpoint:3600/auth`
Body :

```
{
	"email": "user@azerty.com",
	"password": "secret"
}
```

If the login credentials are right, the response should be like:

```
{
"accessToken": "eyJhbGcidOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOiI1ZTIzNjRlZDQ4NDE2YzY2ZjYwMGIwYjgiLCJlbWFpbCI6InZhbGVudGluLmNoZWxsZTNAZ21haWwuY29tIiwicGVybWlzc2lvbkxldmVsIjoxLCJwcm92aWRlciI6ImVtYWlsIiwibmFtZSI6InVuZGVmaW5lZCB1bmRlZmluZWQiLCJyZWZyZXNoS2V5IjoiRUlVUk12NENQKytOZitzSHRnZThFZz09IiwiaWF0IjoxNTc5Mzc5NTY1fQ.jBIa5DNI0ObjVW7i3qF68XguKxuw_4lLmr-5S15rOp4",
"refreshToken": "RFZJZE5YRWldTS3B2bWtUUlByaVZUeVJNTVFyYko5Sm80OUsycWtYUU9PYlFuQURCYkh4K202YWxnd2IybmFiRkQ0TWl2TElQemJKeGUrQ3FpdXVmR3c9PQ=="
}
```

The access token is the famous `json web token`. It is a stateless string that will allow someone to stay logged everytime they provide this token to the server.

## Step 2 : Stay logged with the JWT

In order to make your users stay logged on your app, you have to provide the jwt for each request. To do that,
Grab the `accessToken` from the previous request, prefix it with `Bearer` and add it to the request headers under Authorization.
This will be required for every route with the middleware `ValidationMiddleware.validJWTNeeded` like :

```
  app.patch("/users/:userId", [
    ValidationMiddleware.validJWTNeeded,
    PermissionMiddleware.minimumPermissionLevelRequired(FREE),
    PermissionMiddleware.onlySameUserOrAdminCanDoThisAction,
    UsersController.patchById
  ]);
```
